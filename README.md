# API Server2

This is an example API server that uses MongoDB.

FYI, I initially created this project using the express generator ("npx express-generator") but I removed some of the files to make it easier to understand.

## Usage

You'll need a recent version of Node installed. I tested it using v14.15.5.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new database called "characters" in MongoDB
3. Run "npm install"
4. Run "npm start"

Also, if you're using VSCode then install this REST client (search for "humao.rest-client" in VSCode extensions) and open the apitest.rest file to execute the HTTP requests within VSCode.
